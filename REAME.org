* Tubular

  Tubular is a collection of tools for repairing CRT display devices,
  particularly arcade video game monitors. It includes a simple
  searchable database of CRT information. It’s useful if you’re
  rejuvenating a CRT or [[http://www.junknet.net/donor-tvs][looking for a donor tube to swap into an
  arcade monitor.]]

* Features
  - Includes tube model, heater & G1 voltages, neck socket type,
    color/mono, swapped guns.
  - Data on nearly 9,000 tubes.
  - One HTML page with no external dependencies — use it even if
    you’re offline.
  - Well-behaved, sets browser history as you’d expect.
  - Mobile optimized.

* Using it
  [[http://tubular.atomized.org][It’s online right here]]! Start entering the tube model you’re
  interested in, and it should show up in the list.

* Tube compatibility

  To determine if two tubes are compatible

  1. Enter the source tube mobel into the Tube field, and tap on it in
     the results. The screen results will clear, and a “Compatible
     with” caption appears under the search dialog. Search results
     will now be restricted to tubes compatible with the source.
  2. Enter the potential donor tube model into the Tube
     field. Compatible tubes will appear normally at the top of the
     results, while matching but incompatble tubes will appear grayed
     out at the bottom of the results list.
